# Multi-scale Feature Line Extraction from Raw Point Clouds Based on Local Surface Variation and Anisotropic Contraction

### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (TASE) 2021 paper _Multi-scale Feature Line Extraction from Raw Point Clouds Based on Local Surface Variation and Anisotropic Contraction_. 

### Usage
Please refer to the Readme.pdf

### Related work and dataset
See another learning-based version, which could further enhance the edge extraction accuracy.
We have also developed a new dataset containing diverse aircraft panels for evaluating edge detection. This dataset is available from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17xP0rxk-y29X1497Biwe-JOnbQwe54Do).
