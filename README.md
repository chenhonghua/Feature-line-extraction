See another learning-based version, which could further enhance the edge extraction accuracy.
We have also developed a new dataset containing diverse aircraft panels for evaluating edge detection. This dataset is available from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17xP0rxk-y29X1497Biwe-JOnbQwe54Do).
